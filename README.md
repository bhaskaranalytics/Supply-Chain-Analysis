# Supply-Chain-Analysis
A supply chain analysis project focused on tracking delivery performance (OT, IF, OTIF) using Power BI, uncovering delays, and providing insights to improve service levels. It helped identify top delayed products, key customers affected, and areas needing operational improvement

## Supply Chain Performance Analysis
Worked on a supply chain analysis project where I performed data analysis and built an interactive dashboard using Power BI.

## Problem Statement
A fast-growing FMCG company operating in Gujarat, India, and currently present in three citiesâ€”Surat, Ahmedabad, and Vadodaraâ€”plans to expand to other metro and tier-1 cities within the next two years.

However, some major clients have recently chosen not to renew their annual contracts due to service-related issues. It's suspected that repeated delays and incomplete deliveries of essential products have impacted customer satisfaction. The management wants to resolve these issues before expanding operations.

To do so, the supply chain analytics team was tasked with monitoring daily delivery performance using three key service level metrics:

On-Time Delivery (OT%)

In-Full Delivery (IF%)

On-Time In-Full (OTIF%)

Each metric is tracked against specific target values set for each customer to ensure timely and complete deliveries.

## Project Tasks
In this scenario,stepped into the role of a newly joined data analyst on the supply chain team. The key responsibilities included:

Creating all relevant KPIs as per the metric list

Building a dashboard based on stakeholder expectations discussed in a comic-style meeting transcript

Generating additional insights beyond the stakeholder briefing to identify hidden patterns and problems

## Key Insights
All three core service metrics (OT%, IF%, OTIF%) consistently fall below the set targets

On average, deliveries are delayed by 0.42 days

Certain major clientsâ€”such as Lotus Mart, Coolblue, and Acclaimed Storesâ€”had the highest number of orders and also experienced the most delays

Are we misestimating delivery timelines?

Or are these clients placing more orders than expected?

Products like ghee, curd, and butter face the most frequent delays

Thereâ€™s no significant improvement in performance metrics over recent months

A large gap in IF% suggests possible production or inventory issues
## Conclusion
This project provided valuable hands-on experience in solving real-world supply chain problems using data analysis and Power BI. By tracking OTIF metrics and identifying performance gaps, I was able to surface actionable insights that can help the business improve delivery reliability and customer satisfaction.

The dashboard serves as a dynamic tool for the operations team to monitor daily service levels and respond quickly to any delivery or fulfillment issuesâ€”ultimately supporting better decision-making and long-term growth.
